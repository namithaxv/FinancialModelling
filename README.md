# Financial Modelling

### Outline of the project:
In this project, I analyzed the stock for JP Morgan and Chase (tests for stationarity/data visualization). 
I then used the historical stock data for other major companies (Apple/Google/Mircosoft), and used several optimization metrics to calculate optimal portfolio weights and maximize the Sharpe ratios.

### Important terms:
- **Sharpe Ratios**- a measure used to evaluate the return of an investment compared to its risk. It calculates how much excess return you receive for the extra volatility you endure for holding a riskier asset.
- **Efficient Frontier** - portfolio theory that represents a set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a defined level of risk. It's essentially a boundary line on a risk-return graph that can be used to infer that when portfolios are below this line, they are considered sub-optimal since they don't provide enough for their risk level.
