# Stock Forecast and Portfolio/Risk Assessment 

### Outline of the project:
In this project, I analyzed the stock for JP Morgan and Chase (tests for stationarity/data visualization). 
Using ACF/PACF (Autocorrelation/Partial Correlation Functions), and Auto-Models, I forecasted the JP Morgan Stock based on the past years available stock data.

I then used the historical stock data for other major companies (Apple/Google/Mircosoft), and used several optimization metrics to calculate optimal portfolio weights and maximize the Sharpe ratios.
